# Gene Ontology Database Project

This repository provides resources for setting up and querying Gene Ontology databases using Neo4j and MySQL. The Gene Ontology (GO) database offers a structured and controlled vocabulary for gene and gene product attributes across species.

## Project Overview

This project includes two implementations for storing and querying Gene Ontology data:

1. **Neo4j**: A graph database implementation.
2. **MySQL**: A relational database implementation.

## Database Setup

### Neo4j Setup

1. **Start Neo4j Server**: Make sure your Neo4j server is running.

2. **Setup Neo4j Database Schema**:
   - Execute the code in `Neo4j/neo4j-setup.txt` to create the database schema in Neo4j. 

3. **Run Queries**:
   - Execute the predefined queries found in `Neo4j/neo4j-queries.txt`.

### MySQL Setup

1. **Start MySQL Server**: Ensure your MySQL server is running.

2. **Setup MySQL Database**:
   - Run the SQL script in `MySQL/mysql-setup.sql` to create the database and tables:

3. **Run Queries**:
   - Use your MySQL client or any SQL interface to execute the queries located in `MySQL/mysql-queries.sql`.
